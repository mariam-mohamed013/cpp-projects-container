# 📘 C++ Projects Collection – Algorithms & Systems (by Mariam Mohamed)

This repository contains a collection of C++ mini-projects developed to demonstrate core algorithmic thinking, data structure implementation, and practical programming skills. Each project solves a unique real-world problem or simulates a core computer science concept.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Graph Traversal Tool (BFS & DFS)

A program that allows users to input an undirected graph using edges, then performs:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) using Recursion**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) using Stack (iterative)**

📌 **Key Features**:
- Manual graph input via edges
- Auto-detection of root node
- Works with any integer-labeled nodes
- Demonstrates traversal outputs clearly

🔍 **Concepts Covered**:
- Graphs as adjacency matrices
- Queue and stack-based traversal
- Visiting state and node tracking

### 2️⃣ Hotel Room Booking System

A full-featured room and booking management system that allows adding, deleting, and managing rooms and reservations.

📌 **Key Features**:
- Add/delete hotel rooms with bed types (King, Queen, Single)
- Book rooms by date and check for availability
- Prevent overlapping bookings
- Auto-calculate total bill for stay duration
- Save/load room data from a file (`hotel.txt`)
- View, edit, and delete bookings

🔍 **Concepts Covered**:
- Structures and enums
- File I/O with `fstream`
- Date handling and calculation using `<ctime>`
- Booking conflict detection
- Modular code with reusable functions

---

### 3️⃣ Ribbon Cutting Problem Solver

A recursive algorithm to find the **maximum** and **minimum** number of pieces a ribbon can be cut into using a set of allowed cut lengths.

📌 **Key Features**:
- User inputs ribbon length and allowed cut lengths
- Recursive exploration of all cutting combinations
- Computes the optimal (min & max) number of pieces

🔍 **Concepts Covered**:
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- Problem-solving using brute force
- Edge case handling for invalid input

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used

- C++ Standard Library (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<fstream>`, `<ctime>`, etc.)
- Recursion and backtracking
- Graph traversal algorithms
- File reading/writing and date formatting
- Structs, enums, arrays, and vectors
- Command-line I/O
